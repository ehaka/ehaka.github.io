<p>In this subsection we describe the correspondence between gradings of a Lie algebra \(\g\) and the split tori of its derivation algebra \(\der(\mathfrak{g})\text{.}\) Indeed, gradings of a Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{g}\) are in one-to-one correspondence with algebraic quasitori, see Section 4 of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Kochetov-2009-gradings_on_simple_lie_algebras_survey.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 25: Gradings on finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras">[25]</a>. However, in this study we are only interested in cases when \(\g\) is a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero and the gradings are over torsion-free abelian groups. In this setting, the characterization of gradings in terms of algebraic quasitori can be reduced to studying algebraic subtori of the derivation algebra \(\der(\mathfrak{g})\text{.}\) For computational reasons, we will drop the algebraicity requirement for the subalgebras of \(\der(\mathfrak{g})\text{.}\) This means we lose the one-to-one correspondence described in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Kochetov-2009-gradings_on_simple_lie_algebras_survey.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 25: Gradings on finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras">[25]</a>, but the less restrictive definition will be sufficient for our purposes. In particular, it will simplify the explicit construction of maximal gradings in terms of tori, see <a href="section-constructions.html#section-maximal-construction" class="internal" title="Subsection 3.3: Maximal gradings">Subsection 3.3</a>.</p>
