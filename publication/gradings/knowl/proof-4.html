<p>Let \(\widetilde{\mathcal{V}}\) be the  universal realization of \(\mathcal{V}\text{.}\) By <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/algorithm-integer-vector-grading.html" title="Algorithm 2.14: Universal realization">AlgorithmÂ 2.14</a>, \(\widetilde{\mathcal{V}}\) is a \(\ZZ^n/R\)-grading for some subspace \(R\subset \ZZ^n\text{.}\) The quotient \(\ZZ^n/R\) is isomorphic to a group \(\ZZ^k \times G_t\text{,}\) where \(G_t\) is some finitely generated torsion group.</p>
<p>By assumption there exists a realization of \(\mathcal{V}\) as an \(A\)-grading with \(A\) torsion-free. Since the image of \(G_t\) by a homomorphism must vanish in \(A\text{,}\) we conclude that there are no non-zero weights in \(G_t\text{.}\) Since a universal realization is generated by its weights, we conclude that \(G_t=0\text{,}\) and \(\widetilde{\mathcal{V}}\) is a \(\ZZ^k\)-grading.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-gradings.html#proof-4">in-context</a></span>
