<p>We remark that while maximal gradings are able to detect product structures as indicated above, they are not able to detect all algebraic properties as the layers of a maximal grading may not respect some natural algebraic decompositions. The Lie algebra \(L_{6,24}(1)\) in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Cicalo-deGraaf-Schneider-2012-6d_nilpotent_lie_algebras.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 4: Six-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras">[4]</a> provides examples of two such phenomena. First, its maximal grading is not adapted to its lower central series (this behavior can be also achieved by examples were the maximal grading is very coarse). Secondly, this Lie algebra has a “nice” basis (see <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/MR3911646.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 12: Construction of nice nilpotent Lie groups">[12]</a> for the precise definition and its motivation), but it can be shown that no basis adapted to a maximal grading is nice.</p>
