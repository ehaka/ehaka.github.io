<p>We give a complete listing of the universal realizations for the 669 equivalence classes of gradings for the 46 complex Lie algebras of dimension up to 6 in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/software-lie_algebra_gradings.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 23: ehaka/lie-algebra-gradings">[23]</a>. We also include a similar listing for an extensive (but incomplete) family of 7 dimensional Lie algebras over \(\mathbb{C}\text{.}\) The listing in dimension 7 is incomplete because there are a few uncountable families of 7 dimensional complex Lie algebras that depend on a complex parameter \(\lambda\text{.}\) In these cases, following the study carried out in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/magnin-huge-book.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 29: Adjoint and trivial cohomologies of nilpotent complex Lie algebras of dimension {$\leq 7$}">[29]</a>, we focus on those singular values of \(\lambda\) for which either the Lie algebra cohomology or the adjoint cohomology have different dimensions compared to the rest of the Lie algebras in the same family. We will also include a few examples corresponding to non-singular values.</p>
