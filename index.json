This is a qualitative notion as it is only concerned with the existence of limits of difference quotients. Replacing the qualitative existence by some quantified notion often immediately implies more regularity, e.g. (Hölder) continuity of the derivatives. In this talk I will focus on two notions of quantified flatness. The first is sublinearly bilipschitz equivalences (Cornulier 2011), which can quantify how far a map is from an isometry. The second is the beta-numbers (Jones 1990), which quantify how well a map is approximated by an affine map on any given scale.","tags":null,"title":"Regularity from quantified flatness","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539810000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539810000,"objectID":"b070add7baed1aa0ad5c698537b9ea0c","permalink":"/talk/grenoble_tangent/","publishdate":"2018-10-18T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/talk/grenoble_tangent/","section":"talk","summary":"The regularity of length-minimizing curves on sub-Riemannian manifolds is an open problem, of which quite little is known compared to the Riemannian setting, where classically all minimizers are smooth.

In this talk I will give an overview of the problem and describe a series of results obtained by studying the tangent cone of a minimizing curve. The benefit of the approach is that it allows simplifying the problem to studying minimizers in sub-Riemannian Carnot groups. The group structure is then used for a constructive linear algebraic method to shorten curves, which can prove the non-minimality of some class of curves including for instance curves with corner type singularities.

Our strategy is to study infinitesimal and asymptotic properties of geodesics in Carnot groups equipped with arbitrary sub-Finsler metrics. We show that tangents of Carnot geodesics are geodesics in some groups of lower nilpotency step. Namely, every blowup curve of every geodesic in every Carnot group is still a geodesic in the group modulo its last layer. Then as a consequence we get that in every sub-Riemannian manifold any s times iterated tangent of any geodesic is a line, where s is the step of the sub-Riemannian manifold in question. With a similar approach, we also show that blowdown curves of geodesics in sub-Riemannian Carnot groups are contained in subgroups of lower rank. This latter result is also extended to rough geodesics.","tags":null,"title":"Blowups and blowdowns of geodesics in Carnot groups","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524517200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524517200,"objectID":"80c23d6ee040d26688883d6f6f7d9ccd","permalink":"/talk/padova_corners/","publishdate":"2018-04-24T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/talk/padova_corners/","section":"talk","summary":"The regularity of length-minimizing curves on subriemannian manifolds is an open problem, of which quite little is known outside of some specific cases.

The differentiability problem of geodesics in sub-Riemannian geometry can thus be considered via the study of tangent cones. The dilation structure of Carnot groups is particularly convenient for this study, since the tangents of geodesics become themselves (infinite) geodesics in the same Carnot group. For this reason also the asymptotic properties of infinite geodesics are of interest, since such properties will give restrictions on the possible tangents of geodesics.
